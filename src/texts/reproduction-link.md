If possible, use the [Element Playground](https://play.element-plus.org/) to provide a reproduction.
If the reproduction does not need a build setup, please provide a link to a [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/iamkun/ods20k7t/4), or [CodePen](https://codepen.io/iamkun/pen/YzWMaVr).
If it requires a build setup, you can use [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/element-plus-spa-ms973?file=/src/App.vue) or provide a GitHub repo.
What is a minimal reproduction, and why is it required? Please do not just fill in a random link. We will **close your issue** if you do that.
